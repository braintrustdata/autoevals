After you star a doc, it will live in a section on your doc list called **[My Shortcuts](https://coda.io/shortcuts)**. All starred docs, even from multiple different workspaces, will live in this section.\n\n\n\nStarring docs only saves them to your personal My Shortcuts. It doesn\u2019t affect the view for others in your workspace. If you\u2019re wanting to shortcut docs not just for yourself but also for others in your team or workspace, you\u2019ll [use pinning](https://help.coda.io/en/articles/2865511-starred-pinned-docs) instead."
